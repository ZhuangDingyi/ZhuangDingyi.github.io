* Introduced a general framework with Bias Block to improve the performance of seq2seq extreme long-time prediction.
* Used STGCN, DCRNN and GWNet as base model and chose Matrix Factorization, VAR and SVR as the baseline to prove that our model obtain higher accuracy and stronger interpretability. 
* Geodata visualization with Python and paper writing.
