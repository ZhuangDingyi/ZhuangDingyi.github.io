*Advisor*:  [Prof. Lijun Sun](https://lijunsun.github.io/)  
*Co-worker*: [Yuankai Wu](https://kaimaoge.github.io/)  
*Publication*: Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence  
*Resources*: [AAAI](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/16575) [ar5iv](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2006.07527) [GitHub](https://github.com/Kaimaoge/IGNNK) [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16575)  
* Developed a dynamic sampling based inductive framework of graph neural network to recover data for unsampled sensors on a network/graph structure. 
* Learned the spatial message passing mechanism by generating random subgraph samples and adjacency, then reconstructing signals on them.
* Implemented and outperformed advanced spatial kriging and matrix completion models on various spatiotemporal datasets to test the inductive ability.
* Paper in the proceeding of *AAAI 2021*.
