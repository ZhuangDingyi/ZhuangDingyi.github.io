* Presented SATCN--Spatial Aggregation and Temporal Convolution Networks--a universal and flexible framework to perform spatiotemporal kriging for various spatiotemporal datasets without the need for model specification. 
* Proposed a novel spatial aggregation network (SAN) inspired by Principal Neighborhood Aggregation, which uses multiple aggregation functions to help one node gather diverse information from its neighbors
* Capture temporal dependencies by the temporal convolutional networks, which allows our model to cope with data of diverse sizes. 
* Our results demonstrate the superiority of SATCN over traditional and GNN-based kriging models.
