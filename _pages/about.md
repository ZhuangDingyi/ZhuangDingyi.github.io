I am a second-year Ph.D. student at [MIT JTL Transit Lab](https://mobility.mit.edu/) supervised by [Prof. Jinhua Zhao](https://dusp.mit.edu/faculty/jinhua-zhao). I previously received my M.Eng degree at <u>McGill University</u>, supervised by [Prof. Lijun Sun](https://lijunsun.github.io/). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from <u>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</u> and was a research assistant at <u>National University of Singapore</u>. My supervisors at two universities are [Prof. Jiangang Jin](http://naoce.sjtu.edu.cn/en/teachershow.aspx?info_lb=24&info_id=8&flag=2) and  [Prof. Lee Der-Horng](https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/cee/staff/lee-der-horng/) respectively. Click [here](http://zhuangdingyi.github.io/files/zhuang_dingyi_cv.pdf) to view my up-to-date CV. If you want to know more about me, please feel free to [contact me (dingyi@mit.edu)](mailto:dingyi@mit.edu).


## Research Interests

* Urban computing & smart city
* Graph neural network & complex network 
* Spatiotemporal data mining
* Bayesian probabilistic factorization models
* Reinforcement learning based traffic control

My research interests lie in spatial-temporal data mining and urban computing. Three particular questions are (1) how to adapt advanced graph network methods on transportation system, especially to infer/forecast the states/values of unseen nodes in the network (2) how to utilize interpretability of probabilistic factorization models on mobility modeling (3) how physical traffic flow models can be integrated with (differentiable) deep learning.
