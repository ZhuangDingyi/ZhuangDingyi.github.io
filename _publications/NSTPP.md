*McGill University, Sep. 2020 ~ Nov. 2020*  
*Advisor*:  [Prof. Lijun Sun](https://lijunsun.github.io/)  
Co-worker: [Yuankai Wu](https://kaimaoge.github.io/)  
* Defined the conditional probability functions of accident timing and location as nonlinear functions of the history, whose representation could be effectively learned by sequence-to-sequence networks.
* Formulated the conditional probabilities of future accident timing and location as log-normal mixture models with parameters conditioned on the historical representation.
* Experiments on real-world datasets from three cities confirmed NSTPP's capacity to outperform deep learning and conventional point process in accident prediction
