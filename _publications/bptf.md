*McGill University, May. 2020 ~ Aug. 2020*  
*Advisor*:  [Prof. Lijun Sun](https://lijunsun.github.io/)  
*Resources*: [PDF](https://zhuangdingyi.github.io/files/sparse_demand_estimation.pdf)  
* Derived and implemented Hankel-based Poisson Tensor Factorization to learn latent seasonal spectrum of paratransit service for the disabled people in the region-level.
* Enhanced interpretability traditional probabilistic factorization model, and conducted cases studies on both temporal and spatial latent modes to discover behaviors from sparse and dispersed paratransit data.
