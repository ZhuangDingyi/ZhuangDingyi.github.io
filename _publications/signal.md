*Advisor*:  [Prof. Lijun Sun](https://lijunsun.github.io/)

* Point out that reinforcement learning traffic signal control should not only focus on regular intersection, but also special scenarios like high-way offramps. 
* Both Reinforcement learning efficiency and saftey issues will greatly influenced by scenario changing like simply adding an offramp, which leaves concerns for using reinforcement learning signal control.
