I am a M.Eng (thesis) student in Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics of <u>McGill University</u>. My supervisor in McGill is [Prof. Lijun Sun](https://lijunsun.github.io/). I received my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from <u>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</u> and was a research student of <u>National University of Singapore</u>. My supervisors in two universities are [Prof. Jiangang Jin](http://naoce.sjtu.edu.cn/en/teachershow.aspx?info_lb=24&info_id=8&flag=2) and  [Prof. Lee Der-Horng](https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/cee/staff/lee-der-horng/) respectively. Click [here](http://zhuangdingyi.github.io/files/zhuang_dingyi_cv.pdf) to view my up-to-date CV. If you want to know more about me, please feel free to [contact me (dingyi.zhuang@mail.mcgill.ca)](mailto:dingyi.zhuang@mail.mcgill.ca).


**As estimated to graduate in May 2021, I am actively looking for PhD position in 2021 fall. Feel free to contact me at: dingyi.zhuang@mail.mcgill.ca if you are interested in my research!**

## Research Interests

* Urban computing & smart city
* Graph neural network & complex network 
* Spatiotemporal data mining
* Bayesian probabilistic models
* Reinforcement learning based traffic control

My research interests lie in spatial-temporal data mining and urban computing. Three particular questions are (1) how to adapt advanced graph network methods on transportation system, especially to infer/forecast the states/values of unseen nodes in the network (2) how to utilize interpretability of probabilistic models on mobility modeling (3) how physical traffic flow models can be integrated with (differentiable) deep learning.
