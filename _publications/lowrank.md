* This paper studies the traffic state estimation (TSE) problem using sparse observations from mobile sensors. TSE can be considered a spatiotemporal interpolation problem in which the evolution of traffic variables (e.g., speed/density) is governed by traffic flow dynamics (e.g., partial differential equations).
* We consider TSE as a spatiotemporal matrix completion/interpolation problem, and apply spatiotemporal Hankel delay embedding to transforms the original incomplete matrix to a fourth-order tensor.
* The proposed framework only involves two hyperparametersâ€”spatial and temporal window lengths, which are easy to set given the degree of data sparsity.
